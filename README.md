## Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project

### Overview
Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project, a multifaceted exploration of cryptocurrency data, clustering, and predictive modeling. This project comprises three distinct sections and a broad overview of its objectives. Each section focuses on different aspects of cryptocurrency analysis and machine learning.

### Part 1: K-Means Clustering
In this initial section, we explore the realm of cryptocurrency data. We work with historical data from the top 4 cryptocurrencies over a one-year period. The primary task is to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm, focusing on two key features: "market cap" and "volume." The goal is to create five clusters and visualize the results through a scatter plot.

### Part 2: Hierarchical Clustering for Optimal K
In the second section of our Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project, we dive into hierarchical clustering, not K-Means. The objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for our dataset. We systematically perform hierarchical clustering for various k values, ranging from 1 to 10, and assess the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for each k value. This analysis guides us to select the most appropriate k value for our data.

### Part 3: DBScan Clustering and Predictive Modeling
The third section combines DBScan clustering and predictive modeling. We cluster cryptocurrency data based on "market cap" and "volume" using DBScan. This section challenges us to leverage DBScan effectively to uncover distinct clusters within the cryptocurrency dataset. Simultaneously, we shift our focus to predictive modeling. Our aim is to build a model that predicts whether the
